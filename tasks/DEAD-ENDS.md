# Approaches not to repeat

- Inherited `.lake/build` trees use hard links. Lake updates traces in place
  but replaces objects, allowing another checkout's trace to certify a stale
  object (observed: new `Symbol` with old `CerberusFresh`). Detach artifacts
  with `scripts/isolate_lake_cache.py` under the shared build lock. Never seed
  worktree caches with `cp -al`; use independent files or reflinks.

- F3: feeding reference-run long-double stack bytes to the compiler model
  invalidates independent arena equality. Keep such replay diagnostic only;
  fix and model the conversion independently.
- F3: matching compilation refusals are classifications, not successful
  supported-program compilation or evidence for the headline theorem.
- F1 recovery: several old worktrees have stale generated copies. Edit the
  source and regenerate through scripts/csem_regen.sh; never merge stale
  generated files merely because a cached binary runs.
